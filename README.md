# radio_cover
This project is part of the course Topics in Propagation and Radio-links (9th Semester - ECE AuTH). Goal of this project is the radio-coverage study for a regional unit of Greece
Main topics of the project:
  -Utilization of HeyWISP software to simulate and visualize radio signal propagation and analyze signal strength, coverage areas and transmission quality, accounting for terrain and obstacles
  -Assessment of antenna types, heights, and placements to optimize signal reach and minimize dead zones
  -Evaluation of the impact of geographical features and urban structures on signal attenuation and reflection
  -Optimal positioning for the TV studio and transmission sites to ensure maximum regional coverage
