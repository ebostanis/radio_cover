# radio_cover
This project is part of the course Topics in Propagation and Radio-links (9th Semester - ECE AuTH). Goal of this project is the radio-coverage study of a regional unit of Greece <br>
Main topics of the project: <br>
  -Utilization of HeyWISP software to simulate and visualize radio signal propagation and analyze signal strength, coverage areas and transmission quality, accounting for terrain and obstacles <br>
  -Assessment of antenna types, heights, and placements to optimize signal reach and minimize dead zones <br>
  -Evaluation of the impact of geographical features and urban structures on signal attenuation and reflection <br>
  -Optimal positioning for the TV studio and transmission sites to ensure maximum regional coverage <br>
